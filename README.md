    ðŸŽ¯ About My Repository 
This repository contains various embedded systems projects developed using Code Composer Studio (CCS). Projects are implemented primarily in C++ with occasional use of Assembly language, demonstrating low-level hardware interaction and real-time embedded design capabilities.

Each project focuses on a different aspect of embedded systems development, including:
â€¢	âœ… GPIO control and interrupt handling
â€¢	âœ… Timer configurations and delay generation
â€¢	âœ… ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) integration
â€¢	âœ… UART communication
â€¢	âœ… Bare-metal programming with ARM Assembly
â€¢	âœ… Efficient memory and register-level manipulation

    ðŸš€ Highlights
â€¢	Hybrid use of Assembly and C++ in embedded workflows
â€¢	Demonstrates understanding of bare-metal programming
â€¢	Focused on performance-critical microcontroller projects
â€¢	Emphasizes register-level control without relying on HALs
