    ðŸŽ¯ About My Repository 
This repository contains various embedded systems projects developed using Code Composer Studio (CCS). Projects are implemented using both C++ and Assembly languages (varies on the project), demonstrating low-level hardware interaction and real-time embedded design capabilities.

Each project focuses on a different aspect of embedded systems development, including:

â€¢	âœ… GPIO control and interrupt handling

â€¢	âœ… Timer configurations and delay generation

â€¢	âœ… ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) integration

â€¢	âœ… UART communication

â€¢	âœ… Bare-metal programming with ARM Assembly

â€¢	âœ… Efficient memory and register-level manipulation


    ðŸš€ Highlights
â€¢	Hybrid use of Assembly and C++ in embedded workflows

â€¢	Demonstrates understanding of bare-metal programming

â€¢	Focused on performance-critical microcontroller projects

â€¢	Emphasizes register-level control without relying on HALs
